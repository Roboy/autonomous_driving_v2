To keep it very simple, the consist out of a winch motor that can pull a string. This mimics the way human muscles contract and by using two muscles working in opposite directions (antagonist muscles, compare biceps and triceps) back-and-forth movement is possible.

By placing one Myo-muscles on each side the Roboy Bike can steer itself without the help of Roboy. Together with the angle sensor and the PID steering controller ghost mode steering (steering without the help of Roboy) can be achieved.
