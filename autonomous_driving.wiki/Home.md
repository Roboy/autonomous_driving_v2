# Welcome to the Autonomous Driving Wiki page!
This repository contains the code of Roboy's Autonomous Driving Team from winter term 2018/2019. The semester goal was to enable Roboy to autonomously drives a Rickshaw bike. For more information about the Roboy project visit https://roboy.org/

# Project Overview
If you want to find out about the work that was done in this project without the need for a deep dive into the code, please feel free to read the [Project Overview](https://github.com/Roboy/autonomous_driving/wiki/Documentation-Overview) article.

# Architecture
![Architecture](https://github.com/Roboy/autonomous_driving/blob/wiki-material/wiki-material/architecture.png)

Above, our resulting architecture is shown. We will give more details in the according WIKI pages. For now, just work your way down the sidebar on the right. 

# Repository Structure
[Roboy/autonomous_driving](https://github.com/Roboy/autonomous_driving) is our main repository. It contains a `dockers` directory containing our ... brace yourself ... docker files. It furthermore has a submodule [Roboy/autonomous_driving_src](https://github.com/Roboy/autonomous_driving_src/tree/master) containing everything we need to `catkin build`. The `src` directory contains further code that is either build within docker containers (so we keep [Roboy/autonomous_driving_src](https://github.com/Roboy/autonomous_driving_src/tree/master) clean) or code we used at some point throughout the semester but might have dropped later on. 

# What we accomplished
